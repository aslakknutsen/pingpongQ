= Example

First of all you need to create a WAR file by calling `./gradlew clean assemble`.

After that you need to create a Docker image that contains the output by calling:

`docker build -t lordofthejars/pingpong .`

An alternative of both previous steps would be call next Gradle task:

`./gradlew buildImage`

This command will assemble the WAR file and create the image.

Finally you can go to org.pingpong.PingPongTest test and execute the test.

If you go to `dockerhost:7979` you will get access to hystrix dashboard.
Then you only need to register next stream: `dockerhost:8081/pingpong/hystrix.stream` and you will be able to see hystrix dashboard of PingPong application.
